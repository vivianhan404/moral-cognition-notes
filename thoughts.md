development of different mechanisms
- do they start off the same, and branch off, or are the different mechanisms developed separately from the beginning?
- test different types of problems to try and find some that are "undifferentiated" by age
- differences in explicit and implicit mechanisms - say one thing, but behave in another way

types of responses
- open-ended explanations -> few actual responses, mostly silence
- forced-choice -> potentially spoon-feeding answers
	- sometimes kids can explain even if they couldn't come up with answer themselves

problems that could have different explanations
- or frame same explanation within different frameworks? idk
	- "For instance, people might ask, “Which rule would be best for us all?” (more akin to rule utilitarian theories; e.g., ref. 17), or, instead, “Which rule would everyone agree to?” (more akin to contractualist theories; e.g., ref. 23), and so on" [[Levine, S., Kleiman-Weiner, M., Schulz, L., Tenenbaum, J., & Cushman, F. (2020). The logic of universalization guides moral judgment. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 117(42), 26158-26169.|Levine et al 2020]] 

teaching/learning different rules over the course of the experiment
- like with Junyi's brain-breakers, learning the logic throughout the experiment
