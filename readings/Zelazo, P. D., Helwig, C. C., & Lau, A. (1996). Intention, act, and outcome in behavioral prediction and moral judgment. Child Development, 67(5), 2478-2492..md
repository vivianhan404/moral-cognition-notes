- difficult to separate actions from outcomes
- [[Nelson, S. A. (1980). Factors influencing young children's use of motives and outcomes as moral criteria. Child Development, 823-829.|Nelson 1980]] - youngest at 3yo start considering intentions
- integrating intentions and outcomes (complex task) improves with age
- use non-canonical causal associations (pet enjoys getting hit and in pain when petted)
- given intention, asked to predict behavior (comprehension check?)
	- Cognitive Complexity and Control Theory
- given outcome, asked to give punishment
- 3yo sensitive to harm outside of the act itself
- everyone used outcomes to judge, but for 5yo and adults intentions also mattered
- "the use of intentions in moral judgment depends in part on the particular type of judgment being assessed (act acceptability or punishment) and also on the assessment methodology (qualitative or quantitative)"
