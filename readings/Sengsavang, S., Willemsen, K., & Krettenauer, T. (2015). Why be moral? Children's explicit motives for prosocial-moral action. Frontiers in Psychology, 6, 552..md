# Summary
- most prior research focuses on implicit motivations for prosocial behavior
# Background
- domain theory
	- moral vs social conventional vs prudential
	- moral not affected by culture - it's the right thing to do
		- "establish fairness, avoid harm-doing, and promote other’s well-being"
	- social conventional - "maintain social order"
- children intrinsically want to help others
- implicit vs explicit motives
	- implicit shaped by early experience, cause spontaneous behavior in long-term
	- explicit is taught verbally, behavior is result of "deliberate decision-making"
- understanding rules and giving judgements != motivations for actions
- Eisenberg, N. (1986). Altruistic Emotion, Cognition, and Behavior #toread/moral 
	- "Eisenberg used a broad range of categories for coding reasons children provided when making prosocial decision"
	- concern for others
- positive vs negative moral obligations
	- "children’s explicit motives for prosocial actions might differ from the motives that prevent them from intentionally harming others"
	- Janoff-Bulman, R., Sheikh, S., & Hepp, S. (2009). Proscriptive versus prescriptive morality: two faces of moral regulation. #toread/moral 
# Experiment
### Setup
- questionnaire + interview
- ask about personal experiences for both positive and negative morality
- watched two puppets talk about personal moral preferences, asked to choose between puppets
- asked why they want to be like the puppet? not sure I understood this part
- coded explanations on scale from internal to external motivation
### Results
- "children referred to standards and rules, as well as self-interest more often in the antisocial context, whereas other-oriented motives were more salient in the prosocial context"
