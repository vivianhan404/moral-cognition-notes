lots of content skipped for now #toread/moral 
# Development Lit Review
- prosocial behavior - sociality or morality?
- infants spontaneously engage in social behaviors without external reward
- toddlers recognize distress and show concern
- helper and hinderer study (Hamlin, 2013; Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007) - prefer helpers
- 6yo understand importance of distributing resources fairly
- children cooperate spontaneously
- recognize and generalize differently for moral vs conventional violations
- reasons more nuanced and felt more justified when they themselves were the perpetrator
# Moral Reasoning and Judgement
- judge by physical harm and unfair distribution by infancy and toddlerhood
- through development, children start taking account of social context surrounding actions
- personal experience affect judgements
	- eg early exposure to lots of violence and instability make revenge more permissible
- resource distribution - develop nuance of people's needs, merit, etc
- becoming aware of in-group bias
- viewing rights (eg freedom of speech) as moral instead of legal
