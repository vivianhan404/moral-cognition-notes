# Summary
# Background
- anti-rationalist view - emotions lead to judgements, then reasons added post-hoc
- moral dumbfounding - very sure of a judgement, but unable to justify
	- formula - taboo violated, but no harmful consequences to anybody
- can't justify with harm -> use disgust or emotional reaction
- claim - perceived risk is a valid reason for moral judgement
	- similar to a drunk driver who didn't hit anyone (but had high risk of accident)
### 1. perceived risk of harm correlated with judgements
- two stories - incest and cannibalism
- asked to rate likeliness of harm and wrongness on scale of 1-7
### 2. perceived risk correlated with disgust and judgement -> is a confound in previous studies
- Parkinson, C., Sinnott-Armstrong, W., Koralus, P. E., Mendelovici, A., McGeer, V., & Wheatley, T. (2011). Is morality unified? Evidence that distinct neural systems underlie moral judgments of harm, dishonesty, and disgust. Journal of cognitive neuroscience, 23(10), 3162-3180. #toread/moral 
### 3. salient risks increase severity
- experimentally control salience of risks by listing potential risks after story
- establish causality between perceived risks and judgements
