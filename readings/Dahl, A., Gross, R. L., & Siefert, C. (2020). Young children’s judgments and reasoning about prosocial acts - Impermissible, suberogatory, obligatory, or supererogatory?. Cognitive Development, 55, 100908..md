# Details
- categories of prosocial
	- impermissible - should avoid, must avoid
	- suberogatory - should avoid, ok to not avoid (e.g. talking loudly in a restaurant)
	- obligatory - should do, must do
	- supererogatory - should do, ok to not do (e.g. going out of your way to do something)
- use moral, conventional, other considerations to decide what to do
	- welfare of recipient/helper - low cost, high benefit vs high cost, low benefit
	- interpersonal relationships - family vs strangers
	- moral valence of the goal - recipient is trying to steal vs not steal
- create a pair of stories that vary along each consideration
	- vary the specific situations and prosocial actions
- structured interview -> classify in one of the categories
	1. should the agent help?
	2. do they _need_ to help/avoid? (framed as 'is it ok not to?')
	3. what if there was a rule for/against helping? (opposite of response to 1)
	4. what if they're friends?
- also asked about personal experiences helping others (as a helper, not observer)
	- contexts
		- parents at home
		- helping teachers
		- helping friends
	- asked about should/need to help, then why
- n=52, 3 to 5yo
- children mostly labelled obligatory, adults said wasn't required (supererogatory)
- children don't use social rules to explain
	- moral more important than conventional rules
- "researchers have made theoretical and methodological progress on studying children’s many different motivations to help, including from empathy and intrinsic desires to see others’ helped, concerns with punishments and rewards, and social affiliation (for overviews, see e.g., Eisenberg et al., 2016; Hepach et al., 2012; Paulus, 2014; Warneken, 2015)"
