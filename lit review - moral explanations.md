3. [Weston and Turiel 1980](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1980-32357-001) - generalizability of rules depends on moral/conventional category

## moral judgements
1. [[Kohlberg, L. (1963). The development of children's orientations toward a moral order I. sequence in the development of moral thought. Vita humana, 11-33.|Kohlberg 1963]] - theoretical six stages of moral development
2. [[Brody, G. H., & Henderson, R. W. (1977). Effects of Multiple Model Variations and Rationale Provision on the Moral Judgments and Explanations of Young Children. Child Development, 48(3), 1117–1120.|Brody and Henderson 1977]] - effect of inconsistent role models on moral children's judgements/explanations
	- just coded each judgement/explanation as 'mature' or 'immature' based on which choice the child made
3. [[Costanzo, P. R., Coie, J. D., Grumet, J. F., & Farnill, D. (1973). A reexamination of the effects of intent and consequence on children's moral judgments. Child development, 154-161.|Costanzo et al 1973]] - children use intent in judgements
	- all children use intent for positive consequences, only older children for negative
4. [[Nelson, S. A. (1980). Factors influencing young children's use of motives and outcomes as moral criteria. Child Development, 823-829.|Nelson 1980]] - children are sensitive-ish(?) to motives and consequences
	- 3yo only cared whether there was one negative thing (motive or outcome)
5. [[Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., & Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. Child Development, 67(5), 2478-2492.|Zelazo et al 1996]] - non-canonical animals to disambiguate acts and outcomes
	- animal likes getting hit and gets hurt with pets
	- even 3 year-olds judge based on outcome, not the action itself
	- 5 year-olds start including info on intentions into judgements
6. [Ziv et al 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721002006) - 16-month-olds evaluate agents based on fairness
	- prescribe punishment and reward
## moral explanations
1. [[Dahl, A., Gross, R. L., & Siefert, C. (2020). Young children’s judgments and reasoning about prosocial acts - Impermissible, suberogatory, obligatory, or supererogatory?. Cognitive Development, 55, 100908.|Dahl et al 2020]] - explanations of prosocial acts, 4 categories (impermissible, obligatory, etc)
2. [[Mammen, M., Köymen, B., & Tomasello, M. (2018). The reasons young children give to peers when explaining their judgments of moral and conventional rules. Developmental psychology, 54(2), 254.|Mammen et al 2018]]
	- explain moral violations with facts (because of common knowledge), but explain the rule and limited scope of social conventions
3. [Mammen and Paulus 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201423000412) - theoretical framework for development of moral reasoning #toread/moral 
	- based on social interactions with peers and adults
4. [[Sengsavang, S., Willemsen, K., & Krettenauer, T. (2015). Why be moral? Children's explicit motives for prosocial-moral action. Frontiers in Psychology, 6, 552.|Sengsavang et al 2015]]
	- children have internal motivation to do prosocial behavior
	- more external motivation for avoiding antisocial behavior
	- storybook + interview design
5. [Smetana et al 1999](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203775530-7/children-reasoning-interpersonal-moral-conflicts-judith-smetana-melanie-killen-elliot-turiel) - morals (welfare, rights) vs interpersonal (friendship)
	- weight depends on situation
## misc
1. [Schleihauf et al 2022](https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13758) - distinguish good vs bad reasons starting at 4 years old
	- focuses on reasons in general, not moral justification

# Philosophy

	- rationally something can be seen as 'wrong' without it being irrational to break that, eg eating meat
