2. [[Smetana, J. G., & Braeges, J. L. (1990). The development of toddlers' moral and conventional judgments. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly (1982-), 329-346.|Smetana and Braeges 1990]] - moral/conventional distinction appears at 3 years old
3. [Weston and Turiel 1980](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1980-32357-001) - generalizability of rules depends on moral/conventional category
4. [[Helwig, C. C., & Turiel, E. (2002). Children’s social and moral reasoning. Blackwell handbook of childhood social development, 476-490.|Helwig and Turiel 2002]] - lit review, development of moral vs conventional vs personal
## moral judgements
1. [[Kohlberg, L. (1963). The development of children's orientations toward a moral order I. sequence in the development of moral thought. Vita humana, 11-33.|Kohlberg 1963]] - theoretical six stages of moral development
2. [[Brody, G. H., & Henderson, R. W. (1977). Effects of Multiple Model Variations and Rationale Provision on the Moral Judgments and Explanations of Young Children. Child Development, 48(3), 1117–1120.|Brody and Henderson 1977]] - effect of inconsistent role models on moral children's judgements/explanations
	- just coded each judgement/explanation as 'mature' or 'immature' based on which choice the child made
3. [[Costanzo, P. R., Coie, J. D., Grumet, J. F., & Farnill, D. (1973). A reexamination of the effects of intent and consequence on children's moral judgments. Child development, 154-161.|Costanzo et al 1973]] - children use intent in judgements
	- all children use intent for positive consequences, only older children for negative
4. [[Nelson, S. A. (1980). Factors influencing young children's use of motives and outcomes as moral criteria. Child Development, 823-829.|Nelson 1980]] - children are sensitive-ish(?) to motives and consequences
	- 3yo only cared whether there was one negative thing (motive or outcome)
5. [[Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., & Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. Child Development, 67(5), 2478-2492.|Zelazo et al 1996]] - non-canonical animals to disambiguate acts and outcomes
	- animal likes getting hit and gets hurt with pets
	- even 3 year-olds judge based on outcome, not the action itself
	- 5 year-olds start including info on intentions into judgements
6. [Carpendale 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273229799905002) - theoretical model based on Kohlberg and Piaget
## moral explanations
1. [[Dahl, A., Gross, R. L., & Siefert, C. (2020). Young children’s judgments and reasoning about prosocial acts - Impermissible, suberogatory, obligatory, or supererogatory?. Cognitive Development, 55, 100908.|Dahl et al 2020]] - explanations of prosocial acts, 4 categories (impermissible, obligatory, etc)
2. [[Mammen, M., Köymen, B., & Tomasello, M. (2018). The reasons young children give to peers when explaining their judgments of moral and conventional rules. Developmental psychology, 54(2), 254.|Mammen et al 2018]]
	- explain moral violations with facts (because of common knowledge), but explain the rule and limited scope of social conventions
3. [[Sengsavang, S., Willemsen, K., & Krettenauer, T. (2015). Why be moral? Children's explicit motives for prosocial-moral action. Frontiers in Psychology, 6, 552.|Sengsavang et al 2015]]
	- children have internal motivation to do prosocial behavior
	- more external motivation for avoiding antisocial behavior
	- storybook + interview design
4. [Smetana et al 1999](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203775530-7/children-reasoning-interpersonal-moral-conflicts-judith-smetana-melanie-killen-elliot-turiel) - morals (welfare, rights) vs interpersonal (friendship)
	- weight depends on situation

### prosocial action

Cognitive Development, 55, 100908.|Dahl et al 2020]], [[Sengsavang, S., Willemsen, K., & Krettenauer, T. (2015). Why be moral? Children's explicit motives for prosocial-moral action.

# Adult
1. [[Stanley, M. L., Yin, S., & Sinnott-Armstrong, W. (2019). A reason-based explanation for moral dumbfounding. Judgment and Decision making, 14(2), 120-129.|Stanley et al 2019]]
	- moral dumbfounding - strong judgement with no reasonable explanation
	- used as evidence that emotions guide judgement reasons are calculated post-hoc
	- perceived risk is a confound, matching harm-based judgement mechanisms
