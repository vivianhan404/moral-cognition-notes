### threshold case - buckets and rocks
- significant effect in kids, replicates adult finding

- [stimuli](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e59t6xqsf2ygvwg/kid_threshold_final.pptx?dl=0) and [counterbalance](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b90hswhq2bnok04/kid_threshold_final_counterbalance2.pptx?dl=0)
- age effect older/younger 7.5
- 61/90 no change between stories
### coding (for buckets and rocks)
- tried two different schemes of coding justifications
- data and codes linked in presentation
- Kohlberg findings replicated(?) - adults and children distributions looked very similar
- feature coding - not a lot of usable child justifications
- n=72 children used outcome as a justification and don't show high/low difference
	- remove them from analysis -> high/low interest difference gets bigger
	- 46.2% adults justified using outcome, but still showed a high/low difference
- 26 kids didn't use outcome, 9 showed some signs of universalization
### moral reasons study (choosing explanation)
- [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dBlJRNtH8xI6NCv3DM3sLJmoQ2gKl79B)
- 7 different moral reasons, 7 stories
	- harm, universalization, rule, role, fairness, dislike, disgust
	- two potential explanations for each story -> try to choose the correct one

	- [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XsJTduwpPGbzer3AYAWB5-GNs0d0w3XvtIhCvt2c--I/edit#gid=0)
	- only has the 4 categories harm, outcome, unfair, universalization
	- version 1 - asked if justifications made sense -> most answered yes for all
	- version 2 - pick the best justification
		- works for all but youngest kids, but small sample size
		- potentially kids use process of elimination to understand universalization
